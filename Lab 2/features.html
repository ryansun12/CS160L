    Lab 2 <br>
    10/19/2019
    <p> 
      This lab renders a red cylinder at 0,0 on startup. The cylinder is drawn with 24 triangles using points<br> 
      from a smaller circle with radius = 0.5 at z = 10 to a larger circle with radius = 1.0 at z = 0. <br>
      There is a white light source at the coordinate point (1,1,1).  <br>
      There are three toggle buttons that change the camera position, normal vector display, and the render mode, respectively. <br>
      The camera angles are top and side, normal vectors are shown or hidden, and render mode is either wireframe or flat. <br>
      You can also left click at any point on the canvas to draw a red cylinder at a relative position, right click for a blue one. <br>
