      This lab allows the user to draw red or blue trees onto the canvas depending on whether it was a left or right click. <br> 
      Left click anywhere on the canvas to draw a red fractal tree with length 40 and recursion level 4 <br>
      or right click to draw a blue tree with length 50 and recursion level 6. <br>
      Angles are calculated and scaled based on the previous branch position and level. <br>
      There is a button to toggle between two different viewing angles. Screenshots below show the 2 angles.<br>
